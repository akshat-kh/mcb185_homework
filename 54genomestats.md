This file contains the output generated from program 53, which displays the stats for 
the lengths various GFF features (gene, CDS, exons) in the genomes of A. thaliana, 
C. elegans, and D. melanogaster.

<i>D. melanogaster</i> seems to have been sampled almost 1/3 as much as the other two
organisms, given by their counts. It also appears to have the longest genomic features, on
average
